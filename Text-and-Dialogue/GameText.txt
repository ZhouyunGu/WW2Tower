Siege battles in war are primarly battles where enemy forces slowly choke out the ally forces supply. They do this by surrounding the area that the ally forces are camping in. One important siege battle happen during World War 2 between the German and American army.

Duing December of 1944, the German army initiated a siege battle on the American army. The American army were isolated in the town of Bastogne which is located near Belgium. German's purpose of initiating this battle was to get to the Harbour in Antwerp so they can stop the Ally forces from regrouping. 

There were reasons that this siege battle was bad for the American forces. One main reason was that German troops greatly outnumbered the American forces. During the start of the battle, the number of American troops were close to ten thousand but the number of German troops were in the fifty thousand. Another reason was that American couldnt get their injuried troops out of the Bastogne since the German troops surrounded the town.
